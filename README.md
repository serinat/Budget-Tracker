# Budget-Tracker

- Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.

- The objective of Budget-Tracker is to add functionality to an existing budget app to allow for offline access and functionality by implementing service-worker. The user should be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.
